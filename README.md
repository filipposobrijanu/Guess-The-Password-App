Guess The Password App is a **fast-paced guessing game** that challenges players to uncover a secret password hidden among seven possible words. Each round, the system randomly selects a target word, and players must **deduce the correct answer** through strategic guessing and process of elimination. With **limited attempts** and no hints, the game tests your intuition, vocabulary, and logical reasoning under pressure.
